# GLOBAL METADATA
## Reference: https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-yaml-reference
## The name must be unique in the Snap Store.
## Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
## They cannot be all numbers and they also cannot start or end with a hyphen.
name: owncloud-infinite # you probably want to 'snapcraft register <name>'
## The <base> keyword defines a special kind of snap that provides a run-time environment
## with a minimal set of libraries that are common to most applications.
## They’re transparent to users, but they need to be considered, and specified, when building a snap.
base: core22 # the base snap is the execution environment for this snap
version: "5.0.5+git" # just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
summary: ownCloud infinite scale # 79 char long summary

  To create a truly federated storage architecture oCIS breaks down the old ownCloud 10 user specific namespace, 
  which is assembled on the server side, and makes the individual parts accessible to clients as storage spaces 
  and storage space registries.

# ARCHITECTURES
## builds a snap to run on the same architecture as the build environment.

# SECURITY MODEL
## Because devmode is only intended for development,
## snaps must be set to strict confinement before they can be published as “stable” in the Snap Store.
## Once an app is working well in devmode, you can review confinement violations,
## add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.
confinement: strict # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots
## Defines the quality grade of the snap.
## Can be either devel (i.e. a development version of the snap,
## so not to be published to the stable or candidate channels) or
## stable (i.e. a stable release or release candidate, which can be released to all channels).
## A snap of type app (default) cannot be set to stable if the base is not on a stable channel.
grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels

#? Easy: https://github.com/chirag-jn/snap-int/blob/master/snap-b/snap/snapcraft.yaml
#? Slots are the way a snap provides access to its services or data to other snaps.
# By default, the AppArmor sandbox allows writes to $SNAP_DATA and reads from $SNAP (see Environment variables for details).
# The content interface takes advantage of this feature to map data from other locations to either $SNAP or $SNAP_DATA.
# A bind mount is then created to link $SNAP in one snap (e.g. from /snap/my-snap/1234/content) to an empty directory in the other snap (e.g., to /snap/my-other-snap/4321/incoming-content).
# Locations need to be selected carefully because a bind mount could potentially permit mounts over important locations, such as $SNAP_DATA, preventing access to a snap’s own writable space.
# The same can be done for particular files, if desired, but it requires a pair of interfaces for each file and is more cumbersome.

#? Layouts are transparently supported by Snapcraft when using a base snap (e.g. base: core22).
#? Reference: https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-layouts
#? Example: https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-snap/blob/master/snapcraft.yaml
# As a simple example, consider an application you want to snap that:
#   - stores all data in /var/lib/foo
#   - has a configuration file in /etc/foo.conf
#   - uses read-only data in /usr/share/foo
# A layout that allows such software to be used without snap-specific modifications can be defined as follows:
#! None of the above filesystem modifications are visible to any other snaps, or from the wider user session.
#! They’re only visible within the per-snap mount namespace.
#? Layouts are defined as a key-value map, mapping from a <target-path> to a layout declaration.
#? Each declaration may be one of the following:
#* symlink: <source-path>: create a symbolic link.
#*    This method is preferred because it is the cheapest;
#*    the other methods significantly increase the startup time of your application.
#* bind: <source-path>: bind-mount a directory.
#* bind-file: <source-path>: bind-mount a file
#* type: tmpfs: mount a private temporary in-memory filesystem
layout:
  #* Path to system relevant data.
  #* Because Infinite Scale does not use a database for storing information like users, groups, spaces, internal data, etc.,
  #* it saves all this data to a permanent file location. Depending on the system setup, the base directory contains not
  #* only the metadata but also blobs. See Filesystems and Shared Storage for more details.
  #* The base path has a default location for metadata and service dependent data (see above) which must be on a POSIX storage.
  #* If not otherwise defined when using S3, it is also used to store blobs using that path:
  #*   - For container images (inside the container) => `/var/lib/ocis`
  #*   - For binary releases => `$HOME/.ocis/`
  /var/lib/ocis:
    # bind: $SNAP_DATA/var/lib/ocis
    symlink: $SNAP_COMMON/var/lib/ocis
  # /usr/share/foo:
  #   bind: $SNAP/usr/share/foo
  #* Path to config files.
  #* The configuration directory has a default location for config files, which must be on a POSIX storage:
  #*  - For container images (inside the container) => `/etc/ocis/`
  #*  - For binary releases => `$HOME/.ocis/config/`
  #?    OCIS_CONFIG_DIR: $SNAP_USER_DATA/etc/ocis
  /etc/ocis:
    symlink: $SNAP_DATA/etc/ocis

#? Global environment variables
environment:
  #? `$SNAP_USER_COMMON`
  #? Directory for user data that is common across revisions of a snap.
  #? Unlike `$SNAP_USER_DATA`, data present in this directory is not backed up or restored across snap refresh
  #? and snap revert operations. The directory is suitable for large data that the application can access even
  #? if it was made or modified by a future version of a snap.
  #? `$SNAP_DATA`
  #? Directory for system data of a snap. This directory is owned and writable by root and is meant to be used by background applications
  #? (daemons, services). Unlike `$SNAP_COMMON` this directory is backed up and restored across snap refresh and snap revert operations.
  #? $SNAP_USER_COMMON ==> $HOME/snap/$SNAP_NAME/common
  #? $SNAP_COMMON ==> /var/snap/$SNAP_NAME/common
  #? $SNAP_DATA ==> /var/snap/$SNAP_NAME/$SNAP_REVISION
  #? $SNAP_USER_DATA ==> $HOME/snap/$SNAP_NAME/$SNAP_REVISION

  #* The configuration directory has a default location for config files, which must be on a POSIX storage:

  #*   - For binary releases => `$HOME/.ocis/`
  OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH: $SNAP_COMMON/var/lib/ocis

  #* Path to blobs and metadata if POSIX is used.
  #* Derives from `OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH` if not set otherwise.
  #* Used if `STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER` is set to ocis
  # STORAGE_USERS_OCIS_ROOT: "/media"

  #* Path to metadata if S3 is used.
  #* Derives from OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH if not set otherwise.
  #* Used if STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER is set to s3ng.
  #* See Using S3 for Blobs for the S3 configuration.
  #*   When using S3 for storing user data (blobs), metadata must reside on POSIX. The environment variable responsible for
  #*   storaing metadata in S3 is `STORAGE_USERS_S3NG_ROOT` and derives, if not otherwise defined, from the base directory
  #*   `OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH`. For more details see the section Base Data Directory above.
  # STORAGE_USERS_S3NG_ROOT: xx
  OCIS_LOG_LEVEL: debug
  #* When accessing the server using the hostname or IP:
  #* You must start Infinite Scale using the environment variable OCIS_URL=<hostname or IP>.
  #* See the following sections for more details and information: https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/deployment/general/general-info.html#using-a-reverse-proxy
  #? OCIS_URL
  #* Use the environment variable OCIS_URL to define how Infinite Scale can be accessed;
  #* mandatory is the use of https as protocol for the URL.
  OCIS_URL: "https://localhost:9200"
  #* This tells Infinite Scale to bind it to all available network interfaces.
  # PROXY_HTTP_ADDR: "0.0.0.0:9200"
  #* This causes Infinite Scale to only bind to the local network interface.
  PROXY_HTTP_ADDR: "0.0.0.0:9200"
  OCIS_INSECURE: "false" #* Embedded Self-Signed Certificates
  # *    If no reverse proxy is set up, the PROXY_TLS environment variable must be set to true because the embedded libreConnect
  # *      shipped with the IDP service has a hard check if the connection is on TLS and uses the HTTPS protocol.
  # *      If this mismatches, an error will be logged and no connection from the client can be established.
  # *    PROXY_TLS can be set to false if a reverse proxy is used and the https connection is terminated at the reverse proxy.
  # *      When setting to false, the communication between the reverse proxy and Infinite Scale is not secured.
  # *      If set to true, you must provide certificates.
